I hope you're doing well. I’ve reviewed the logs after completing the OOBE and entering the TV plugin for the first time, but it seems that some logs are missing from the initial check. I’ve requested the logs again, but they are still incomplete.

Could you kindly help by providing the full logs? I would really appreciate your support in capturing the complete data. Your help would be incredibly valuable for us to troubleshoot this issue.

I understand this might take some of your time, and I truly hope for your assistance. I would be very grateful and happy if you could help. I’ve tried my best to reproduce the issue, but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to. The pop-up still shows when I try to recreate it.

Thank you so much for your assistance!

Best regards,
